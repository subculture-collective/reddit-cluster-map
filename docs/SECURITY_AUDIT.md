## Penetration Testing Procedures

### Pre-Testing Phase

1. **Scope Definition**
   - Define in-scope systems and endpoints
   - Identify out-of-scope components
   - Get written authorization
   - Set testing windows

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Use dedicated testing environment
   - Backup production data if testing staging
   - Configure monitoring and logging
   - Prepare tools and scripts

3. **Reconnaissance**
   - Map API endpoints
   - Identify technologies and versions
   - Review public documentation
   - Enumerate user roles and permissions

### Active Testing Phase

#### 1. Authentication Testing

**Test Admin API Authentication:**
```bash
# Test without token
curl -v http://localhost:8080/api/admin/services

# Test with invalid token
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/admin/services

# Test with valid token
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/admin/services
```

**Test Token Bruteforce Protection:**
```bash
# Run automated script to test rate limiting on auth endpoints
# Should be blocked after multiple failed attempts
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer wrong-token-$i" \
    http://localhost:8080/api/admin/services
  sleep 0.1
done
```

#### 2. Input Validation Testing

**Test SQL Injection:**
```bash
# Test on query parameters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/graph?max_nodes=' OR '1'='1"

# Test on path parameters
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/communities/'; DROP TABLE users;--"
```

**Test XSS:**
```bash
# Test reflected XSS
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/graph?test=<script>alert('XSS')</script>"

# Test stored XSS via crawl endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/crawl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"subreddit": "<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>"}'
```

**Test Path Traversal:**
```bash
# Test backup download endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/admin/backups/../../../etc/passwd"
```

#### 3. Authorization Testing

**Test Horizontal Privilege Escalation:**
```bash
# Attempt to access other users' data
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/users/other_user_id"
```

**Test Vertical Privilege Escalation:**
```bash
# Try to access admin endpoints without proper token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"crawler": "stop"}'
```

#### 4. Rate Limiting Testing

**Test Global Rate Limit:**
```bash
# Send rapid requests to test rate limiting
ab -n 500 -c 50 http://localhost:8080/api/graph
```

**Test Per-IP Rate Limit:**
```bash
# Test from single IP
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/api/graph
done | grep -c 429
```

#### 5. Business Logic Testing

**Test Resource Exhaustion:**
```bash
# Request maximum nodes/links
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/graph?max_nodes=999999999&max_links=999999999"

# Submit multiple concurrent crawl jobs
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/crawl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"subreddit": "test'$i'"}' &
done
```

#### 6. API Abuse Testing

**Test Parameter Tampering:**
```bash
# Test negative values
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/graph?max_nodes=-1"

# Test invalid data types
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/graph?max_nodes=abc"

# Test extremely large values
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/graph?max_nodes=9999999999999999999"
```

### Post-Testing Phase

1. **Vulnerability Verification**
   - Confirm all findings
   - Categorize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Document reproduction steps
   - Capture evidence (screenshots, logs)

2. **Report Generation**
   - Use the Security Audit Report template
   - Include executive summary
   - Provide detailed findings
   - Suggest remediation steps

3. **Cleanup**
   - Remove test data
   - Revert any changes
   - Archive test results

## Automated Security Testing

See `scripts/security-test.sh` for automated security testing script.

### Running Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
./scripts/security-test.sh

# Run specific test suite
./scripts/security-test.sh --suite auth
./scripts/security-test.sh --suite input
./scripts/security-test.sh --suite rate-limit
./scripts/security-test.sh --suite headers
```

### CI/CD Integration

Security tests run automatically on:
- Every push to main/develop branches
- Every pull request
- Daily scheduled scans
- Manual workflow trigger

See `.github/workflows/security.yml` for configuration.

## Manual Security Testing

### Tools Required

   ```

2. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Set admin token for testing
   export ADMIN_API_TOKEN="test-token-for-security-audit"
   ```

3. **Run Manual Tests:**
