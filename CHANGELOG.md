   - Add the release date
   - Create a new empty `[Unreleased]` section at the top
3. Commit the changes with message: `chore: release v{VERSION}`
4. Create and push a git tag: `git tag -a v{VERSION} -m "Release v{VERSION}"`
5. Push the tag: `git push origin v{VERSION}`
6. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Generate release notes
   - Build and publish Docker images
